I am currently holding a postdoctoral researcher role at the Institute of Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities (ISILC) at Victoria University since June 2021. ISILC is a cross-disciplinary research centre creating solutions for present social, economic, environmental and technical challenges. My research involves the cumulating experiences throughout my career, focusing on multi-disciplinary sustainable and innovative design and construction. The design and construction of built environment are commonly based on standards that emphasise the structural aspects and safety of the structure. Factors related to environmental and economic criteria are rarely given. Considering the growing demand for sustainable approaches driven mainly by climate change concerns, I am using novel methodologies such as 

- Sustainability analysis (life cycle cost, LCC, and life cycle assessment, LCA),
- Multi-physics finite element modelling (FEM), and
- Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.

Research experience
======
I have had the opportunity to work in excellent and supportive environments throughout my career as a researcher. I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne, Australia, where I was trained by Prof Priyan Mendis, an internationally renowned professor in infrastructure engineering and the director of the ARC Centre for Advanced Manufacturing of Prefabricated Modular Housing (ARC-CAMP.H). I also worked with Dr Kasun Shanaka Kristombu Baduge, a postdoctoral research fellow and the manager at ARC CAMP.H. During my PhD, I also had the opportunity to work at the University of Alberta, Canada with Prof Mohamed Al-Hussein, the chair in the automation and industrialisation of building construction in the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. 

Industry experience
======
I had the opportunity to work as a Data Analyst and Scientist at Envirosuite, Australia. This position in the industry had allowed me to perform data analysis and data science related to aviation noise management and sound recognition using deep learning neural networks (e.g., ANN and CNN).

Global network
======
My experience in developing novel, data-driven research projects related to architectural, environmental, geotechnical and structural engineering have enabled me to collaborate with various companies and academic institutions in Australia, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to conduct inventive research projects. These institutions include:

- Australian Reinforcing Company, Melbourne, Australia
- Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), Australia
- De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines
- OzFlux, Australia
- Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea
- The University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada
- Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Japan
