I am currently a project officer at Energy Networks Australia (ENA). I am responsible for supporting the delivery of advocacy and policy development projects towards the development of the renewable gas industry. 

Prior to joining ENA, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities (ISILC) at Victoria University. ISILC is a cross-disciplinary research centre creating solutions for present social, economic, environmental, and technical challenges. My research interests include sustainable engineering, innovative design, and construction automation. I have been using novel methodologies such as
- Sustainability analysis (life cycle cost, LCC, and life cycle assessment, LCA),
- Multi-physics finite element modelling (FEM), 
- Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and
- Remote sensing.

Industry experience
======
I had the opportunity to work as a Data Analyst and Scientist at Envirosuite, Australia. This position in the industry allowed me to perform data analysis and data science related to aviation noise management and sound recognition using deep learning neural networks (e.g., ANN and CNN). I had experience as an innovation engineering consultant whilst pursuing my PhD at ARC-CAMP.H, collaborating with industry partners in solving civil engineering challenges related to soil movement and structural prefabrication.

Research experience
======
I have had the opportunity to work in excellent and supportive environments throughout my career as a researcher. I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne, Australia, where I was trained by Prof Priyan Mendis, an internationally renowned professor in infrastructure engineering and the director of the ARC Centre for Advanced Manufacturing of Prefabricated Modular Housing (ARC-CAMP.H). I also worked with Dr Kasun Shanaka Kristombu Baduge, a postdoctoral research fellow and the manager at ARC CAMP.H. During my PhD, I also had the opportunity to work at the University of Alberta, Canada with Prof Mohamed Al-Hussein, the chair in the automation and industrialisation of building construction in the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. 

Global network
======
My experience in developing novel, data-driven research projects related to architectural, environmental, geotechnical, and structural engineering has enabled me to collaborate with various companies and academic institutions in Australia, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to conduct inventive research projects. These institutions include:

- Australian Reinforcing Company, Melbourne, Australia
- Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), Australia
- De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines
- OzFlux, Australia
- Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea
- The University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada
- Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Japan
