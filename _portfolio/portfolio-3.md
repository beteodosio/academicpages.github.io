This project investigates the structural, thermal, and environmental performance of waffle rafts with recycled plastic formwork. This study will assess and compare full-scale field monitoring between waffle rafts with recycled plastic formwork and a conventional waffle raft formed using Expanded Polystyrene (EPS).  A multi-physical finite element model will be developed to investigate the structural and thermal difference, which will be used in the life cycle cost (LCC) analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA). The recyclability and reusability of each system will also be compared, which will deepen our knowledge in the effect of residential slab formwork in influencing building performance, circularity, and recoverability.
