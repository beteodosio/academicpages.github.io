This project aims to monitor and model climate change hazards to obtain a more resilient and sustainable community. The methods that have been used in this project include finite element modelling (FEM) and remote sensing. 

The graphic below shows a revisit on the state of regrowth in the Mallacoota area, almost two years after the bushfire 2019-2021 using Sentinel 2. This shows the Relativised Burn Ratio (RBR)  
* Photo 1 = between 21/Dec/2019 and 30/Mar/2020 (right before the start and the end of the 2019-2020 Mallacoota bushfire) and 
* Photo 2 = between 30/Mar/2020 and 20/Dec/2021 (from the end of the 2019-2020 Mallacoota bushfire up to the present time). 

The RBR shows the relativity of vegetation growth and burned areas. In the animation below, we can observe that after almost two years there is a slow recovery in Mallacoota.
