Insignificant sustainable advancements of shallow footing systems and their susceptibility to reactive soil shrink-swell movement-induced damage prompt the need to enhance the design and construction of substructures founded on reactive or expansive soils. A practical three-dimensional coupled hydro-mechanical finite element model was developed to perform parametric simulations, which enabled a deeper understanding of the soil-structure interaction and improved footing design equations. This model was further used to propose a novel method to design connections for prefabricated footings and to investigate their global performance and sustainability.
