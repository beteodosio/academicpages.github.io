Shallow footing systems are prone to damage due to the shrinking and swelling of the ground. A paradigm shift to a more sustainable design prompts this project to develop a practical three-dimensional finite element model to perform parametric simulations considering the soil and footing behaviour and interaction. This enabled a deeper understanding of the soil-structure interaction and improved the footing design accuracy. This model was further used to propose a novel method to design connections for prefabricated footings and to investigate their global performance and sustainability.
